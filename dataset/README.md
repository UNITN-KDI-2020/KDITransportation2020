This folder contains all the dataset collected and their evolution during the different project phases.
The sub folders listed here, specify the location for the datasets managed during each phase, plus the "source" folder that contains eventually initial datasets provided for the project, and the "final result" folder which contains the final version of the datasets as project result.
In this way the history of the project datasetes will be always available. Moreover each evolution step on the datasets remain separate and could be used for different purposes.
